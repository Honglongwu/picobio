"""Python script using a Bloom filter to select raw sequencing reads.

Often you can have sequence read data for a large genome (or even a
metagenome or other mixed sample), yet for a particular analysis be
interested only in reads mapping to a quite small reference set (e.g.
organelles like the mitochondria or chloroplast, or a symbiont, or
even just some particular genes of interest). You may want to try
several different read mapping protocols (e.g. a parameter sweep),
and doing this with the full read set would be too slow.

The idea of this tool is to act as a pre-filter, removing reads which
won't map, to concentrate only on those which might map.

The intension is to take as input a raw unaligned sequence read file
as input (in FASTQ, FASTA, SFF, or even unaligned SAM/BAM format),
and produce a filtered version as output.

You would also provide a set of linear and/or circular reference
sequences, the filtered output would only be reads which might map
to these reference sequences (the Bloom filter is probabilitistic,
but also we're only going to search for k-mers within each read,
not perform a full alignment).
