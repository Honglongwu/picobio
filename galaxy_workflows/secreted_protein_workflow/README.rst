This is package is a Galaxy workflow for the identification of candidate
secreted proteins from a given protein FASATA file.

It runs SignalP v3.0 and selects only proteins with a strong predicted
signal peptide, and then runs TMHMM v2.0 on those, and selects only
proteins without a predicted trans-membrane helix. This workflow was
used in Kikuchi et al (2001), and is a simplification of the candidate
effector protocol described in Jones et al (2009).

Availability
============

This workflow is available to download and/or install from the main
Galaxy Tool Shed:

http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/secreted_protein_workflow

Test releases (which should not normally be used) are on the Test Tool Shed:

http://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/secreted_protein_workflow

Development is being done on github here:

https://github.com/peterjc/picobio/tree/master/galaxy_workflows/secreted_protein_workflow


Dependencies
============

These dependencies should be resolved automatically via the Galaxy Tool Shed:

* http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/tmhmm_and_signalp
* http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/seq_filter_by_id

However, at the time of writing those Galaxy tools have their own
dependencies required for this workflow which require manual
installation (SignalP v3.0 and TMHMM v2.0).

To prepare the tar-ball for uploading to the Tool Shed, I use this:

    $ tar -cf secreted_protein_workflow.tar.gz README.rst repository_dependencies.xml secreted_protein_workflow.ga

Check this,

    $ tar -tzf secreted_protein_workflow.tar.gz
