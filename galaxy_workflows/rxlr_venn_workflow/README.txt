This Tool Shed Repository contains a workflow for comparing three RXLR prediction methods with a Venn Diagram, and creates a FASTA file of any proteins passing all three methods.

Availability
============

This workflow is available on the main Galaxy Tool Shed:
http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/rxlr_venn_workflow

Development is being done on github here:
https://github.com/peterjc/picobio/tree/master/galaxy_workflows/rxlr_venn_workflow


Dependencies
============

These dependencies should be resolved automatically via the Galaxy Tool Shed:
 * http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/tmhmm_and_signalp
 * http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/seq_filter_by_id
 * http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/venn_list

However, at the time of writing those Galaxy tools have their own dependencies
required for this workflow which require manual installation (SignalP v3.0,
HMMER v2.0, and the R/Bioconductor package limma).
