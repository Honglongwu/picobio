This is package is a Galaxy workflow for comparing three RXLR prediction
methods with a Venn Diagram, and creates a FASTA file of any proteins
passing all three methods.

See http://www.galaxyproject.org for information about the Galaxy Project.

Availability
============

This workflow is available on the main Galaxy Tool Shed:
http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/rxlr_venn_workflow

Test releases (which should not be used) are on the Test Tool Shed:
http://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/rxlr_venn_workflow

Development is being done on github here:
https://github.com/peterjc/picobio/tree/master/galaxy_workflows/rxlr_venn_workflow


Dependencies
============

These dependencies should be resolved automatically via the Galaxy Tool Shed:
 * http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/tmhmm_and_signalp
 * http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/seq_filter_by_id
 * http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/venn_list

However, at the time of writing those Galaxy tools have their own dependencies
required for this workflow which require manual installation (SignalP v3.0,
HMMER v2.0, and the R/Bioconductor package limma).


Developers
==========

This workflow is under source code control here:

https://github.com/peterjc/picobio/tree/master/galaxy_workflows/rxlr_venn_workflow

To prepare the tar-ball for uploading to the Tool Shed, I use this:

$ tar -cf rxlr_venn_workflow.tar.gz README.txt repository_dependencies.xml rxlr_venn_workflow.ga

Check this,

$ tar -tzf rxlr_venn_workflow.tar.gz
README.txt
repository_dependencies.xml
rxlr_venn_workflow.ga
