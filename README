This is the README file for the picobio repository,
https://github.com/peterjc/picobio

This is a small general hold all for Miscellaneous
Bioinformatics scripts etc mostly in Python, written
by Peter Cock.

The name is a play on pico meaning small (10^-12), and
the Japanense phonetics of my name (romaji).
